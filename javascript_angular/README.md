# Angular Signup page

Complete user registration flow by setting up routing, integrating the signup form with data services and adding proper input validation.

## Introduction

This app is nearly completed, yet the user signup page and results page are missing. Follow the instructions below in order to complete the project.

## Task Description

The HTML and styling of the form are provided. Your job is to connect it to Angular and add proper validation.

Use **Template-Driven Forms** approach when implementing the requirements.

### 1. Implement service to get country and states

- Implement methods to fetch data of `country` and `state`

- Data for `countries` and `states` should be fetched from `assets/data.json` file

- The stub for `country` fetching service is already present, but its methods are not implemented yet

- Integrate this service with `SignupForm` in step 2 service configuration

### 2. Module setup

- Setup `SignupFormComponent` - add required modules, services

- Finish `SignupDetailsComponent` implementation

### 3. Setup routes

- Set the default route to render `SignupFormComponent`

- Setup signup results route so that `SignupDetailsComponent` is rendered for `/signup-details` url

### 4. Add validation to fields

- All fields should be required

- `Email` should be validated (use Angular built-in email validation)

- `Password` should match pattern - minimum 8 characters - numbers, letters, at least one upper case.

- `Password` match value should match password value

- `Phone` should allow only numbers and match pattern `(#99) 999-9999`, where `#` denotes a non-zero digit, and `9` any digit

- Use service to populate `States` and `Country` dropdown

- Values of the `State` field should be loaded based on selected `country` value

- When `country` is selected or changed, `state` should display the default value

- If a field is invalid it should be marked as such - use Angular validation

### 5. Some user feedback

- If a field is invalid, it should display error

- Use error elements that are provided

- Make sure elements include the correct class, i.e. `.form-username-error`

- Don't hide elements with CSS if there is no error. Make sure they are not present in DOM

### 6. Display Results

- Make sure when _Signup Form_ is submitted (not only with button) the component emits proper `save` event that the parent component can subscribe to

- Prevent the event from occurring if any of form fields are invalid

- Use `SignupService` to store and retrieve data submitted in the signup form. Redirect to _Signup Details_ page after successful form submission.

- _Signup Details_ should appear in the same place where _Signup Form_ currently is.

## Setup

1. `npm install` to get dependencies
2. Start app with `npm run start` and point a web browser to `http://localhost:4200/`
3. Use `npm run test:watch` to see tests failing
4. Fix issues so that tests pass
5. Solve all of the issues mentioned here
6. Create a pull request for your solution

## Structure

Please note, that some tests rely on the public API of your components. If you rename something, e.g. `FieldmatchesDirective` to a different name or put it at a different location, some tests will fail, because they're bound to specific classes available at specific file locations. If you rename anything that should not be renamed, tests in `structure.spec.ts` will alert you with the details.

However, you are free to add new components, services etc.
